That's the season. A loss from a five-hole goal in a shootout. Looking forward to October. #Caps

In shootout on final day of regular season, #Bolts beat #Caps. Will host #Habs for first round home ice in #Tampa beginning Wed. #NHL
Fitting end to what I only assume is Oates' last game. Holtby was great at least #Caps
Well, now I just feel empty inside. See you in October #Caps.

#Caps you suck at shootouts. That was horrendous. #Lightning with home is in MTL vs. TBL matchup. Off to Florida for Game 1 Wed?
And #Caps 2014 offseason is underway.

I've never seen so many tweets featuring the word "fitting " #Caps
Pretty from Kuznetsov. Forgot to score though. #Caps
Nice to see the #Caps gave max effort for the fans on the last day of the season, at least, right?
#Caps have done the thing I hate most in hockey the most in history. End this fucking season already.
Home ice advantage in the playoffs being decided in a shoot out. I don’t like it. #Lightning #Caps
