#Algebra, #trigonometry and #calculus came from #India. #QuadraticEquations were by #Sridharacharya in the 11 th century .

RT @AlanZucconi: Of course: ?3/2!!! It couldn't be anything but ?3/2... #GameDev #hexagon #trigonometry
That feeling when you walk out of a mid-sem and you've failed so miserably that it's almost funny #trigonometry #unimelb
I've never been more clueless #trigonometry
Math class just made my day :) #outside #trigonometry
I ,,got a B+ ,,,,trig MY nig #trigonometry #challenge mii http://t.co/1TfuLGvSts
OUr #trigonometry website got 5 stars from a Merlot editor: http://t.co/rwKA2NY7zA  #oer
The satisfied madafaking feeling of actually taking 10 minutes to solve an add maths question and getting the answer right. #trigonometry
RT @uclassDOTorg: Another reason to love #trigonometry and #math. Enjoy your Friday, #teachers! http://t.co/flWLXeKSL2
So I just got through programming the beginning stages of a 3D platforming engine. I wouldn't have been able to do it without #trigonometry.
Why is geometry a required class? When am I ever going to have to find the angle of a triangle?! #trigonometry #SOHCAHTOA
Tired #test #today #trigonometry

No cosign #trigonometry
homework sucks so much. #trigonometry #geometry ????????
After 6 pages of triangles & scribbles I realise I probably should have listened in maths #trigonometry #retard
Of course: ?3/2!!! It couldn't be anything but ?3/2... #GameDev #hexagon #trigonometry
at least I went from a 32% to a 46% #trigonometry
getting triggy with it in math @pradogeometry #trigonometry
#trigonometry is one way hell no turning back -___-
Behind me is infinite power, before me is endless possibility, around me is boundless opportunity! #calculus #math #algebra #trigonometry
