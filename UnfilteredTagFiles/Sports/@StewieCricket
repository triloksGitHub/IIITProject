I used to like @GraemeSmith49 ie until I saw this photo @StewieCricket
@StewieCricket @MarkRamprakash Maybe it's the female touch @Arsenal have been missing!
@StewieCricket @kiesy_22 @MarkRamprakash 2 home grown players in that team
RT @MarkRamprakash: Another stunning and breathtaking display by Chelski v 10-man Swansea, hammering them 1-0! #dull @StewieCricket
@GraemeSmith49 I have evidence of the great @StewieCricket touching a Liverpool crest!!!! #LFC
@StewieCricket @MarkRamprakash cool a new twitter double act
@StewieCricket @kiesy_22 @MarkRamprakash anyone who doesn't think they have spent a fortune on that team has got their head in the sand
@StewieCricket @GraemeSmith49 Dead right Stewie, tell him! Biff, that is just WRONG!
RT @StewieCricket: @GraemeSmith49 Pleased @LFC looked after you and you enjoyed such a special day. Stamford Bridge is your next stop!
@StewieCricket what's your opinion of @chelseafc fans singing during minute silence #ynwa #justicefor96
@StewieCricket @MarkRamprakash isn't football meant to be entertaining when fans spend so much money on tickets, travel, tv, food, drinks??

RT @GraemeSmith49: @StewieCricket stewie you legend what a day!bought you a @LFC shirt for training tomorrow.
@StewieCricket @MarkRamprakash Instead of a striker I think Wenger should put in a bid for Chelsea's lady doctor. Look at the Injury League
@MarkRamprakash @StewieCricket was entertaining watching Arsenal struggle against a championship team yesterday
@StewieCricket @MarkRamprakash With respect, Stewie I'd rather do it the @Arsenal way. It's just difficult with only half a team
@StewieCricket @MarkRamprakash ouch, you want some aloe vera for that burn Ramps?!

@MarkRamprakash @StewieCricket making Arsenal look like a pub team wasn't boring was it but then again all the top clubs have too. Gutless
@StewieCricket we were lucky your strikers couldn't finish a dinner! #notaprobforme

@StewieCricket @GraemeSmith49 @LFC Dont worry both LFC and MCFC have to come to Selhurst yet.  You know what happened there Alec :-)
@MarkRamprakash @StewieCricket Pretty stunning and breathtaking against your lot, Mark? You were too, just not in the right sense...
@GraemeSmith49 @MatchDayApp think @StewieCricket  might not like it tomorrow at training.
RT @kiesy_22: @MarkRamprakash I know that's aimed at City and not Chelsea.. Otherwise I'll be getting in contact with @StewieCricket #chels…
