@NHoultCricket Saying on Cricinfo that @AlexHales1 has been dropped. Good enough for England, not good enough for Notts!
@NHoultCricket in my opinion Mick is the best candidate for the job. Very good domestic track record and did a good job with the Lions in WI
@NHoultCricket None of that language here - not at Lord's
@NHoultCricket he's part of the England clique now don't you know, where's broad too.? Busy making TV adverts.? #burnout
@NHoultCricket Any chance of a test recall this summer or is a tour more likely?
@NHoultCricket no , inside the shopping centre. just a lot of times past Boots.
@NHoultCricket Hales should be sent out on loan
@NHoultCricket Four out of five. Tony Penberthy squeezed out Nigel Felton.
@NHoultCricket ECB were more effective in banning Maurice Holmes
Giridhar's Cricket Daily is out! http://t.co/vEDjvuYK9G Stories via @Cricket365 @NHoultCricket
@NHoultCricket Wonder why that is. He's not injured is he?
@NHoultCricket injured? Got a 50 last week
@PaulFrame85 @NHoultCricket He is in. Tell him to get his whites washed
@TheCricketGeek @PaulFrame85 @NHoultCricket Damn... and to think Robbie Joseph was a free agent until a few days ago!
@NHoultCricket hope you sent that email?!
@TheCricketGeek I hear that @NHoultCricket is available.
@NHoultCricket has Finn looked good?
@NHoultCricket nick still waiting for that email??!
RT @NHoultCricket: Finn takes his 4th wicket. Wessels caught at at slip for 58.
@miller_cricket @WisdenAlmanack @NHoultCricket  looks like he's enjoying himself...
@CharlesDagnall obviously didn't make it to the Desh! @NHoultCricket
@NHoultCricket and he plays his first league match next Saturday against us. #dons #bringonthenewseason
@NHoultCricket Yes, we are away to Frinton next Saturday for the first league match. Today's game will be a pre-season friendly.
RT @NHoultCricket: Mervyn Westfield returns to cricket today ... Make debut for Frinton against Harold Wood
@NHoultCricket yeh sure they will be buzzing the way he is bringing on Hales 4 day batting!!
@the_topspin @NHoultCricket Penberthy was my fave player in the 90's for the county, what he up to now do u know?
@NHoultCricket the hypocrisy of english cricket knows no bounds. Pathetic.
@NHoultCricket Very surprised. I know he got a duck in the second innings last match against Lancs, but did score a solid 61 in the first.
@NHoultCricket Not that surprising after his terrible first class season last year.

@NHoultCricket can see a butler situation where he leaves to pursue his own personal goals.
@NHoultCricket that rather encapsulates Finn too.
