Good Job Good effort @TSN_Sports
RT @playbyplay21: @TSN_Sports when are you going to start airing Sunday night baseball again - love the added Monday & Wednesday - now just…
RT @TSN_Sports: The Masters are underway! Here's Palmer, Nicklaus and Player with the ceremonial tee-off: http://t.co/0IDM57xNyE http://t.c…
@TSN_Sports always giving me updates http://t.co/NGaABl1d2r
@ScottNoddin8 @SportsnetPR @TSN_Sports ok, cool. Thanks
@TSN_Sports thanks for making sure that no Canadian can watch Sunday Night Baseball tonight unless they stream it illegally. what a joke...
One face isn't enough for @phoenixcoyotes captain Shane Doan.  #NeckFace @NHL @TSN_Sports http://t.co/ms963Ymk2O
Have a feeling that won't be the last time we see @Sproully93 on @TSN_Sports #buzzing #firsthit #lasthit #moreclappers
Watched the first shoot out on @TSN_Sports between Toronto and Ottawa and now the last between Ottawa and Pittsburg sens win first and last
So @TSN_Sports buys right to SNB, doesn't air it and won't let it be shown on MLB Extra Innings. Consumers come last I suppose.
RT @kteichert11: No Sunday Night Baseball on @TSN_Sports for a 2nd week in a row.  Why bother purchasing the rights?
RT @BostonElliott: Yay i was also looking forward to the meaningless game between pitt and ottawa. So much on the line @TSN_Sports
Always classy teemu, giguere deserved that! @AnaheimDucks @Avalanche @TSN_Sports
@TSN_Sports when are you going to start airing Sunday night baseball again - love the added Monday & Wednesday - now just want Sunday back
@TSN_Sports will this mean preempting baseball again?
RT @KennedyMLB: The @TSN_Sports Priorities:  Replay of Masters > Sunday Night Baseball
RT @MLS_Canada: @TSN_Sports I know you won't respond but that would be nice but why is there is no Sunday night baseball game on?
Dear @TSN_Sports,  Please keep Jeff O'Neil far away from #Sens regional broadcasts next year.
@TSN_Sports where is Sunday Night Baseball?
@TSN_Sports where is the Yankees redsox game?!
@TSNBobMcKenzie it will be 12 long years. @TSN_Sports is far superior to @Sportsnet and @cbcsports
Man I hope @cbc and @TSN_Sports have ALL if the @CanadiensMTL playoff games on tv  #GOHABSGO
@TSN_Sports Where's Sunday Night Baseball?
Hey @TSN_Sports did you forget to put the Sunday Night Baseball game on tonight or what? I mean it's only Yankees-Red Sox...
@TSN_Sports where's Sunday Night Baseball?!!
@TSN_Sports  thanks for not showing the @DallasStars  now I have to watch van cal. Not all Canadians like Canadian teams. Thk god theyR done
As a sports network @TSN_Sports you should know Yankees Red Sox is the biggest rivalry in all of sports. Pittsburgh Ottawa isn't a rvilary
@TSNBobMcKenzie you and the rest of the @TSN_Sports crew have been a pleasure to watch. True professionals and best @NHL coverage.
@PatG1990 @TSN_Sports So rattling! How are we not gettin Sox Yanks right now?!
And @TSN_Sports blows it again.. Not showin the Red Sox And Yankees... Sweeeeeet
@TinaRyan36 I'm watching on MLB tv... I don't leave it to chance with @TSN_Sports ... Ridiculous they're not showing Red Sox/Yanks though
@TSN_Sports    You turkeys are an #evil #disgrace to sports journalism.  Two weeks running without Sunday Night Badeball #disgrace  As usual
@TSNBobMcKenzie I hope @TSN_Sports goes big on the IIHFWHC. It's a great tourney and I am sure TSN can do for it what you did for the WJHC
@TSN_Sports glad your playing masters reruns instead of the sox yankees. #Bubba wins now put live sports on you donkeys
RT @2_5_10_GM: @TSN_Sports Nick Di Ruzza and @john_byermann have been traded from the yellow kings to the black hawks #BHTalk #YKTalk #Warr…
@TSN_Sports Will feature @Avalanche and Patrick Roy old team the @CanadiensMTL for 2014 Stanley Cup finals.
RT @cschille: This completely meaningless Sens Pens game is prob way better than the Yanks Sox Sunday nighter #not @TSN_Sports
Legal Look: Ryan Malone's arrest and his NHL future: Go to TSN.ca for details.... http://t.co/kpPS64qPM9 via @TSN_Sports #NHL #TBLightning
@TSN_Sports Please RT: Congrats to Sunday night men's league champs Pot Bellied Stallion.  2-1 victory to clinch championship.  #PBSHockey
@TSN_Sports no Sunday night baseball?
Seriously @TSN_Sports Spezzas shootout goal not worthy of the honour roll but two Raptors dunks are?
@Don_inOakville Can't believe @TSN_Sports didn't hand O'Neill a razor before going on air.
Toronto Raptors "Northern Uprising" 2014 Playoffs: http://t.co/FvegtJlG4M via @Raptors @TSN_Sports @DeMar_DeRozan check out my video please!

Oh boy, @strombone1 is gonna be the new Maggie the Monkey on @TSN_Sports. Can't wait.
RT @TSN_Sports: TSN's first round NHL Playoff broadcast coverage will feature: BOS/DET; NYR/PHI; COL/MIN; ANA/DAL #TSN #NHL
Thanks again @TSN_Sports RT @Buster_ESPN That was a great Sunday Night game. Tons of great plays, big pitches, interesting stuff happening.
@TSN_Sports @TSN_News I do swear on Twitter ever but, Why the fuck are you guys replaying the Masters instead of Sunday Night Baseball? #WTF
@TSN_Sports According to http://t.co/c4XyRmR5kd and my guide, Stars at Coyotes was supposed to be JIP on TSN. Do you know why it wasn't?
I personally think this game going to a shootout is a sign that the Hockey Gods don't want @TSN_Sports to stop broadcasting #NHLonTSN
@TSN_Sports I know you won't respond but that would be nice but why is there is no Sunday night baseball game on?
RT @deebsy92: @TSN_Sports @TSN_News I do swear on Twitter ever but, Why the fuck are you guys replaying the Masters instead of Sunday Night…
@KennedyMLB @TSN_Sports FUCKING TYPICAL
Already ready for hockey season again #BestTimeOfYear #PleaseHurry @TSNBobMcKenzie @TSN_Sports
@TSN_Sports thank god I'm watching a replay of the Masters instead of the LIVE Yankees vs Red Sox game.... #smh #amateurhour
@TSN_Sports @SportsCentre I’m pretty sure that Spezza’s shootout goal was nicer than that Raptors dunk! Spezza should have the HON!
RT @THEKyleMoffatt: @TSN_Sports is the worst network. Bullshit hockey w/ a game that means NOTHING over Yankees Red Sox. We need REAL sport…
Why isn't Johnny's goal on @TSN_Sports website yet
@TSN_Sports where's the Yankees/Boston game? #sundaynightbaseball
@TSN_Sports That's your best headline? Double Bubba? Got a gum fetish? No Bubba 2.0? How about '**** Tiger, we got Bubba"! #TheMasters
@TSN_Sports how come no @espn Sunday Night Baseball this year in Canada? Missing @Yankees vs @RedSox #RedSoxNation
How awesome is that all @Avalanche first round games r on @TSN_Sports #WhyNotUs #Avalanche #StanleyCup
RT @stephlachance: Hey @TSN_Sports, start showing Sunday Night Baseball or give up the rights to someone who will!
RT @paul_barnes: Soooo we get a replay of The Masters on TSN2 instead of live Sunday Night Baseball?  #TSNFail @TSN_Sports
Hey @TSN_Sports, start showing Sunday Night Baseball or give up the rights to someone who will!
@K_Murray01 @TSN_Sports MLB TV me
@cracks1313 @TSN_Sports Hmm, why not TSN?
@fattydart @SportsnetPR @TSN_Sports TSN usually has it but chose to show Masters replay tonight on TSN2 instead.....
@TSN_Sports just watched highlights of a soccer game that you are currently playing a rerun of on tsn2. Why do you even have two channels
@TSN_Sports where's Sunday night Baseball this year???????
@TSNBobMcKenzie any chance @ShawnMcKenzieSN is pulling some strings with the old man for a job @TSN_Sports
RT @Jam_Robinson: Thanks again @TSN_Sports RT @Buster_ESPN That was a great Sunday Night game. Tons of great plays, big pitches, interestin…
Soooo we get a replay of The Masters on TSN2 instead of live Sunday Night Baseball?  #TSNFail @TSN_Sports
The @TSN_Sports Priorities:  Replay of Masters > Sunday Night Baseball
Guess @TSN_Sports is still jealous Rogers got the NHL rights so they are punishing baseball fans by not showing the only ball game they get.
@TSN_Sports why no Sunday night Baseball? You're showing a re run of the masters in TSN2 #disappointing
@KennedyMLB @TSN_Sports I'm watching it on RDS. Brutal TSN.
@TSN_Sports  has FIVE bluejay stories on app headlines, not one on the largest EPL game of the year at Liverpool. TORONTO SN again.
Figure it out @TSN_Sports Sunday night prime time two weeks now
@TSN_Sports where can watch BOS-NY Sunday Night Baseball?
Dear @SportsCentre How is Spezza shootout goal not in your honour roll? Also why is it not the Highlight of the Night? @TSN_Sports
RT @yyccrow: @TinaRyan36 I'm watching on MLB tv... I don't leave it to chance with @TSN_Sports ... Ridiculous they're not showing Red Sox/Y…
No Sunday Night Baseball on @TSN_Sports for a 2nd week in a row.  Why bother purchasing the rights?
@Dejan_Kovacevic well @TSN_Sports sez it's ok cause Glass is on the ice. So there.
@jasoncollette wish we could we see it but @TSN_Sports decided to buy rights to SNB so they could black it out from Canadian viewers.
“@TSN_Sports: TSN's first round NHL Playoff broadcast coverage will feature: BOS/DET; NYR/PHI; COL/MIN; ANA/DAL #TSN #NHL” #Habs
I'd rather have Pierre McGuire back on TSN than see Rogers broadcast NHL games for the next 12 seasons. This is gonna be awful. @TSN_Sports
@recent5 @TSN_Sports TSN - the hoarders of sports media. #SundayNightNetflix #DangerZone
@TSN_Sports Please tell me you guys are showing the Raptors playoff games on TSN and not TSN2...
@alaind_ns @TSN_Sports Not A Clue, I Guess Watching @bubbawatson Win The mAsters Again Is More Important Than Yankees-Red Sox
@kteichert11 @TSN_Sports They must be as sick of Bosox-Yankees as I am #sundaynightnetflix
