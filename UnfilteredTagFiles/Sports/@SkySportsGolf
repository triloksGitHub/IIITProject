@SkySportsGolf more shot tracker please. Don't just keep it for the ppl who's out. Wanna watch bubba Watson's fly #Masters2014
Has anyone told Adam Scott that if he has a birdie he doesnt have to bogey next hole to level it up ! @SkySportsGolf
@SkySportsGolf having to watch rickie fowler progress on my masters app due to lack of coverage on a guy currently tied fourth!
@SkySportsGolf Who else thinks Kooooooooooch is gonna WIN it?
RT @SkySportsGolf: 11th hole this week: Bubba Par-Par-Par; Spieth Par-Bogey-Bogey.
Masters is so so boring without tiger @SkySportsGolf
RT @4golfonline: @BBCSport #kenonthecourse #a4paper #2tennisballs so much better than sky pad and @SkySportsGolf. #entertaining
Advantage Bubba @SkySportsGolf #TheMasters
@SkySportsGolf what happens if Fowler wins and you realise you haven't showed any of his final round shots???
@SkySportsGolf I'm sorry, we shouldn't fight. Just lots of pro tracer please
@SkySportsGolf a switch to bbc one is going to happen due to your poor poor coverage of all players
This is going all the way between Spieth and Bubba! @SkySportsGolf #Masters2014
@louiscampbell94 @SkySportsGolf it's true instead we have to deal with watching mcilroys shitty tee shot every time?
Have to say @SkySportsGolf have beasted the @BBCSport in terms of the masters coverage this year! #Masters2014
RT @SkySportsGolf: They say the #Masters doesn't start until the back 9 on Sunday.... Too tight to call
@SkySportsGolf 9th green might as well be taken from a crazy golf course!
@lewis306 @SkySportsGolf I know , there's no buzz or excitement just ?
RT @GolfColliBerici: @SkySportsGolf what a great Masters!
Can @SkySportsGolf please stop showing players not in contention at the #masters  Mcilroy or Westwood aren't going to win!!!
It's turning into a classic! Superb @bubbawatson. @JordanSpieth losing momentum. Lots of #golf to play though. #TheMasters @SkySportsGolf
@SkySportsGolf why didn't you use it for kuchar? I hate you
Pro tracer is gold @SkySportsGolf ... Looking forward to seeing #Bubba take on 13 with it! #Masters2014
@SkySportsGolf Are the previews of the holes at the masters computer animated or actual videos?
@SkySportsGolf Time to pension off Bruce Critchley; Jordan Spieth, not Jonathan. Mistakes as regular as his namesake, Forsyth #masters
@SkySportsGolf theres a shock ! Scott birdie bogey routine continues !
@SkySportsGolf drop Monty. Bad attitude, poor understanding of the situations and overpaid. Give a talented commentator a break instead.
@SkySportsGolf  - Critchley's back - "Jonathon Spieth" Good grief!!
@SkySportsGolf I reckon -6 could win this #TheMasters
@SkySportsGolf Please stop saying that Bubba has never had a #golf lesson or we #PGA coaching pros will be out of a job! #MastersSunday
@JordanSpieth playing well on final day. Looking forward to seeing you at british open @theopen2014 @SkySportsGolf
“@mojwade: @SkySportsGolf any word on the pro tracer? I can see you're online” #Masters2014

"Ho ho, Rickie Fowler, that's right, pop it baby!" #ButchHarmon #themasters @SkySportsGolf #loveit
@SkySportsGolf Guys, watching on interactive. Looks in cruise control when not really contending. Who was the best golfer under pressure?
So... Tim Barter... You're getting PAID to go to America and interview golfers at the #Masters! Cheer the fuck up!! @SkySportsGolf
@SkySportsin3D @Spookyfish @SkySportsGolf 3D just hasn't taken off has it. 4K is the future!!
@4golfonline @SkySportsGolf sky's exclusive coverage of most golf is a  major inhibitor of the games growth. Disastrous for the sport..
@BBCMOTD or @SkySportsGolf with the masters? Liverpool won and I'm in for money with the golf! Both great watches! Which one!?
Spieth is lighting it up @SkySportsGolf #TheMasters
@SkySportsGolf The greens are slower than reg tour pace. Spoiled the normal Sunday spectacle! Bad decision!

@SkySportsGolf why is there more coverage for Rory who is miles behind yet nothing for the likes of Miguel who is way in front of him.
RT @SkySportsGolf: Holes 10, 11 and 12 could be hugely pivotal. They're playing as the 7th, 1st and 4th hardest holes today.
@SkySportsGolf why does the sound of the ball-strike sound willowy
RT @SkySportsGolf: Nine holes to go in the 2014 Masters. Watson or Spieth? Or can someone from the chasing pack produce a back nine charge?
@BBCSport #kenonthecourse #a4paper #2tennisballs so much better than sky pad and @SkySportsGolf. #entertaining
This Speith fella isn't too shabby at golf. @SkySportsGolf #MastersSunday #MastersOnSky
'Wee Mon' @McIlroyRory talking lot of sense on @SkySportsGolf. If only #Spieth could hear him, in danger of unraveling here #Masters
@SkySportsGolf @walshey246 such a banger
@SkySportsGolf no. You are thinking of the national. And there were more than two horses.
Spleith is Cool as a cucumber @SkySportsGolf
"Happiness is a long walk with a putter" #Masters2014 @SkySportsGolf
@SkySportsGolf persevering showing over the top coverage of the English golfers even though they are out of the tournament #MastersSunday
I had forgotten how shit Colin Montgomery is at commentary. @SkySportsGolf #TheMasters
Nipping to @BBCTwo as cannot abide Colin Mont'fucking'gomery on @SkySportsGolf any longer #Masters2014
@davehillier74 @markdavin2010 @SkySportsGolf don't complain, US coverage is shocking #needkenonthecourse #almostmissingmonty
Need to visit @The_Masters #Masters  as @SkySportsGolf and @BBCSport concentrate on Europeans?
@SkySportsGolf any danger of showing any of ricky fowlers shots? Fuckin hell
@SkySportsGolf Colin Montgomerie is the worst commentator in the universe.
Bubba Watson hasn't started that well but remember he started off with a bogey on the final day when he won it in 2012 @SkySportsGolf
@SkySportsGolf no coverage of jim furyk?
@SkySportsGolf why do you not show the #Masters2014 in 3D anymore??
Its getting twitchy at Augusta, must be green jacket time @SkySportsGolf
#kenonthecourse makes the @BBCSport  coverage better than @SkySportsGolf #signhimup
@JordanSpieth on fire! One hell of a bunker shot! Gotta love @The_Masters on @SkySportsGolf
@SkySportsGolf why no rickie fowler
@SkySportsGolf why is the masters not in 3D #poor
Time to move to BBC. Monty has started 'commentating' for Sky. @SkySportsGolf
@SkySportsGolf how good is it listening to Jack Nicklaus?????
RT @SkySportsGolf: With Jordan Spieth and Bubba Watson making rare birdie twos at 4 and 6, is this becoming a two-horse race?
@SkySportsGolf are you gonna show any golf? £80 a month just to watch golf interrupted by Ladbrokes adverts every 10 mins.#shitcoverage
@Baggers_Alex @markdavin2010 @SkySportsGolf tuned back into  #MastersOnSky now. #jacksgonetobed
@SkySportsGolf Was really enjoying the golf until Monty came back on. Can you please release a Monty schedule so people can plan around him?
@SkySportsGolf Guys please don't keep going on about the speed of the greens! They,re the slowest I,ve seen them in many yrs.Big pity!
@BBCSport @SkySportsGolf This is not @DonaldsonJamie 1st masters, he had a hole in 1 on the 6th last year!
@RuMacdonald @SkySportsGolf until Monty shows up then I am off to BBC
@SkySportsGolf what's happened to 3D? #Masters
its a shame about @SkySportsGolf : the Euro commentators are always so biased. you need a different channel or mute sound. #every #week
@GaryEvansGolf Think it's so he can't hear Monty on @SkySportsGolf ?
#TheMasters @SkySportsGolf  If #KevinStadler wins he might pose a major problem for Augustas Tailor! #2Jackets
@SkySportsGolf please let Monty go home now . He is destroying this #MastersSunday
@SkySportsGolf - why does Mr. montgomerie have to talk so much, please just let us watch #THEMastersSunday. It make it so much better.
@SkySportsGolf showing every shot of Westwood at +1 and no shots of Jimenez, Furyk who are all under par and can still win #TheMasters
Listening to colin montgomorie's commentary on @SkySportsGolf coverage of #Masters2014 makes me feel like shoving a screw driver in my ears
The only American I'd be happy with winning today is that young man Jordan Speith ....#youngestwinnerinhistory @SkySportsGolf @The_Masters
@mikeygala @SkySportsGolf Correct, and we could do that better that him.
@BBCSport coverage of #TheMasters is a lot better than @SkySportsGolf. #justsaying #myopinion
@LeeWestwoodGolf bunker shot was so good! @bubbawatson ghost giving a line! @paddypower @SkySportsGolf http://t.co/xg8HDXNNic
@PWGolfer @SkySportsGolf surely the virgin Mary or a crucifix should be in there somewhere?
@batchy1989 @SkySportsGolf Its missing Tiger.. Id pay so much money for a round at Augusta.
@SkySportsGolf how come there's no 3D coverage ? #TheMasters
@SkySportsGolf Bit disappointed that Kuchar isn't being shown as much as the rest.
@4golfonline @SkySportsGolf @BBCSport too right. Get out on the course and show us more. #bbcforme
Don't Spieth too soon..... #Masters2014  @SkySportsGolf
Is Jordan #Speith wearing the green clothes in anticipation of not being a fashion victim? #Masters2014 @SkySportsGolf
@BROWNTAIPAN @SkySportsGolf yep cheers Dave have turn over to BBC2 ??
@SkySportsGolf is @RickieFowlerPGA banned from your coverage or something? The guy is two shots off lead at the masters...
Fred Couples is very very sexy........we'll worth the watch @SkySportsGolf #Masters2014
@SkySportsGolf trying to watch live the masters but can't find a page on my ipad someone know's where ??
No Masters in 3d this year?? @SkySportsGolf @SkySportsin3D
@fuller125 @NLGALtd @AG430  @SkySportsGolf for me buddy. #golf #HDgolf
Come on @SkySportsGolf, get Butch Harmon in the commentary box. The only man who can get away with descibing spectators as patrons.
@SkySportsGolf your coverage is absolutely pathetic, instead of showing the leaders, were sitting watching Lee Westwood religiously...
@SkySportsGolf what on earth is banging around in the commentary box, #annoying
No-one better than @KenBrownGolf. Much to learn @SkySportsGolf grasshopper ... #succint
@SkySportsGolf Is Monty off air yet? #dull

RT @SkySportsGolf: Holes 10, 11 and 12 could be hugely pivotal. They're playing as the 7th, 1st and 4th hardest holes today.
@SkySportsGolf Probably not. It could well be a two-golfer race though.
@SkySportsGolf great Colin never one a major now talking his bullshit#stuckuptwat
@SkySportsGolf plenty of footage but where the heck is rickie fowler?????
About 5 weeks ago I said I was want to keep an eye on Speith. Little did I think he would be in contention for the #masters @SkySportsGolf
@SkySportsGolf can someone tell Monty to stop rejoicing at the failure of the young American Spieth. It cones across very badly #Masters2014
Anyone who picks @SkySportsGolf's Masters coverage ahead of the @BBCSport needs their head testing.
@The_Masters @SkySportsGolf why is the coverage so bad.. no Fowler.. all westwood @+1
Love Listening to the Great Jack Nicklaus on @SkySportsGolf shame it's only for a few hours! #Masters2014

Imperious coverage of #Masters2014 by @SkySportsGolf.
.@SkySportsGolf I would sooo love the coolest man in golf to win today - Miguel Angel Jimenez #Masters2014
@SkySportsGolf Absolutely wonderful to hear Jack commentate with Ewen. His knowledge is astounding and you know how much he loves the game.
@Ad1golfnut @SkySportsGolf does he mention how often he won a major??
@mikejtucker007 @SkySportsGolf he's a Troon lad too Mike. I have to agree though. Bruce Critchley now, agh no more!!
Love Jack's chat about J Grout - quite right golfers must become their own best instructor @SkySportsGolf
@sevegiardina @SkySportsGolf thanks Seve, Nike would fear their flaws being shown ;-)
This final round sunday at the Masters is gonna be quality viewing @SkySportsGolf @The_Masters
@SkySportsGolf how do you play as good in tournaments as you do in practice rounds? #AskJack #JackNicklaus #Masters2014
@SkySportsGolf why do you persist with Nicklaus and his boring voice commentating. It's enough after the first hour.
