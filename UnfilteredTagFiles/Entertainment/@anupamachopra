@anupamachopra , Saw Alia-Arjun's interview. I think Arjun Kapoor is not at quiet. He talks too much, while not giving Alia chance to talk..
What! Wait! What! @iamsrk #AmritaSingh was your childhood friend!! Wow! What a journey you guys have had.. #KingofB'wood @anupamachopra

@anupamachopra Arjun Kapoor needs training on how to give interviews. He was cutting Alia through put the interview which was frustrating.
