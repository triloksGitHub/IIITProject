@GuitarHero @RockBand Wouldnt the Smart thing to do be to market out another batch of guitar controllers so gamer's could Afford them?

@RockBand is it possible to somehow get a Wii RB2 code to import into RB3? I have a new Wii and lost my manual in my last move.
@RockBand Should find a new manufacture company then would bring cost down on guitars and then we could keep playing.

@RockBand is probably one of my favorite games. Each Harmonix GH and RB game has been excellent.
